# Unsupervised Learning

Objective:
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate my understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

## Key components
1. Loads the Iris dataset from sklearn.
2. Droped the species column since this is a clustering problem.
3. Implemented KMeans clustering and Hierarchical clustering algorithms.
4. Visualized the clusters for both algorithms.
5. Provided brief descriptions of how each algorithm works.
6. Explained why each algorithm might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
